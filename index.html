 <h2>My experience with git</h2>

 <h3>Thursday October 17, 2019</h3>
 <p>
   In web development version controlling is central concept. Git, being the best of version controlling systems it is very important to understand the inner workings of this system. Starting from day one when I start my web development carrier at Gerorge Washington coding bootcamp, I worked with github working on my codes and other people's code. I have a  good experience pushing, branching and merging codes, raising issues, submitting pull requests, resolving conflicts and using stash and pop. All in all I have a very good working knowledge in git and github.
 </p>
 <p>
   I will also blog about full stack web development mainly concentrating on ruby on rails and javascript. I will post the links for some of the web applications I have developed showcasing the skills and knowledge I gained.
